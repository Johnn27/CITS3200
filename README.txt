This project was undertook by the above students on behalf of Florian Klonek
of the Centre for Transformative Work Design

This is an app for monitoring 'research impact', or the relative frequency of
mentions in recent news and scientific articles for keywords relating to 
research projects. 

The source directory is organised to work as a MEAN stack web app. It has serve
side files such as server.js and those in /app/ and client side files such as
index.html and those in /assets/. There is also two dependency libraries, 
node_modules and bower_components.

To run the application, see INSTALL.txt.
